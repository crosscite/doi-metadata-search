# memcached Cookbook
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/memcached.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/memcached) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/memcached.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/memcached)

Installs/configures a single memcached instance managed by the systems init system.  Also provides a custom resource to set up one or more memcached instances running under runit.

## Requirements
### Platforms
- Debian / Ubuntu
- RHEL and derivatives
- Fedora
- openSUSE/SLES
- SmartOS base64 1.8.1 - Note that SMF directly configures memcached with no opportunity to alter settings. If you need custom parameters, use the `memcached_instance` provider instead.

### Chef
- Chef 12+

### Cookbooks
- runit
- yum-epel
- compat_resource

## Attributes
The following are node attributes are used to configure `/etc/memcached.conf` if using the default.rb recipe. They are not used if using the memcached_instance custom resource.
- `memcached['memory']` - maximum memory for memcached instances.
- `memcached['user']` - user to run memcached as.
- `memcached['port']` - TCP port for memcached to listen on.
- `memcached['udp_port']` - UDP port for memcached to listen on.
- `memcached['listen']` - IP address for memcache to listen on, defaults to **0.0.0.0** (world accessible).
- `memcached['maxconn']` - maximum number of connections to accept (defaults to 1024)
- `memcached['max_object_size']` - maximum size of an object to cache (defaults to 1MB)
- `memcached['logfilepath']` - path to directory where log file will be written.
- `memcached['logfilename']` - logfile to which memcached output will be redirected in $logfilepath/$logfilename.
- `memcached['threads']` - Number of threads to use to process incoming requests. The default is 4.
- `memcached['experimental_options']` - Comma separated list of extended or experimental options. (array)
- `memcached['ulimit']` - boolean `true` will set the ulimit to the `maxconn` value

## Usage
This cookbook can be used to to setup a single memcached instance running under the system's init provider by including `memcached::default` on your runlist.  The above documented attributes can be used to control the configuration of that service.

The cookbook can also within other cookbooks in your infrastructure with the `memcached_instance` custom resource.  See the documentation below for the usage and examples of that custom resource.

##Custom Resources

### instance
Adds or removes an instance of memcached running under the runit supervisor.

#### Actions
- :add: Add a new instance
- :remove: Remove an existing instance

#### Properties
- :memory - the amount of memory allocated for the cache. default: 64
- :port - the TCP port to listen on. default: 11,211
- :udp_port - the UDP port to listen on. default: 11,211
- :listen - the IP to listen on. default: '0.0.0.0'
- :maxconn - the maximum number of connections to accept. default: 1024
- :user - the user to run as
- :threads - the number of threads to use
- :max_object_size - the largest object size to store
- :experimental_options - an array of additional config options
- :ulimit - the ulimit setting to use for the service
- :template_cookbook - the cookbook containing the runit service template. default: memcached

#### Examples
Create a new memcached instance named super_custom_memcached:

```ruby
memcached_instance 'super_custom_memcached' do
  port 11_212
  memory 128
end
```

Stop and disable the super_custom_memcached instance:

```ruby
memcached_instance 'super_custom_memcached'  do
  action :remove
end
```
