# rsyslog Cookbook CHANGELOG
This file is used to list changes made in each version of the rsyslog cookbook.

## v.4.0.0 (2015-12-09)
- Removed support for Chef Solo. Since this cookbook now supports Chef 12+ only it makes far more sense to use Chef Zero (local mode) if a Chef server is not available.
- Removed yum from the Berksfile as it wasn't being used
- Fixed bad variables being passed in the file_input custom resource
- Added Chefspec matchers

## v.3.0.0 (2015-11-09)
- Breaking change: The file_input LWRP has been updated to be a Chef 12.5 custom_resource, with backwards compatibility to all Chef 12.x released provided by compat_resource. Additionally the 'source' and 'cookbook' attributes in the file_input resource have been renamed to 'template_source' and 'cookbook_source' to prevent failures.
- Helpers for determining the service provider on Ubuntu have been removed since Chef 12 does the right thing with Init, Upstart, and systemd.
- rsyslog::client no longer fails if there are no servers to forward logs to. Instead forwarding isn't configuring and a warning is written to the chef client log
- Fix broken templating of /etc/rsyslog.d/49-remote.conf when relp was enabled.  Added testing to prevent future regressions here.
- Test Kitchen integration tests are now run via Travis so all PRs will be fully tested

## v.2.2.0 (2015-10-05)
- Add why-run support to the file_input LWRP
- Added support for rsyslog under systemd on Ubuntu 15.04+
- Added new attribute node['rsyslog']['custom_remote'].  See readme for additional information
- Added source_url and issues_url metadata for Supermarket
- Fixed 49-relp.conf to honor logs_to_forward so it didn't just forward everything
- Updated contributing and testing docs
- Set the minimum supported Chef release to 11.0
- Added maintainers.toml and maintainers.md files
- Added Amazon Linux, Oracle, and Scientific Linux to the metadata
- Removed all pre-Ruby 1.9 hash rockets
- Updated development dependencies in the
- Fix a bad example attribute in the readme
- Updated Travis CI config to test on all modern Ruby releases

## v.2.1.0 (2015-07-22)
- Fixed minor markdown errors in the readme
- Allow the server to listen on both TCP and UDP.  For both set node['rsyslog']['protocol'] to 'udptcp'
- Move the include for /etc/rsyslog.d/ to the very end of the rsyslog.conf config
- Added the ability to bind to a specific IP when running the server on UDP with node['rsyslog']['bind']
- Sync the comments in the rsyslog.conf file with the latest upstream rsyslog release
- Change emerg to log to :omusrmsg:_ vs. _ on modern rsyslog releases to avoid deprecation warnings

## v.2.0.0 (2015-05-18)
Note: This version includes several breaking changes for Ubuntu users. Be sure to take care when deploying these changes to production systems.
- 49-relp.conf now properly uses the list of servers discovered in the client recipe
- Fixed a typo that prevented file-input.conf from properly templating
- Added allow_non_local attribute to allow non-local messages. This defaults to false, which preserves the previous functionality
- The rsyslog directory permissions are now properly set using the user/group attributes instead of root/root
- Properly drop permissions on Ubuntu systems to syslog/syslog.  Introduces 2 new attributes to control the user/group: priv_user and priv_group
- Remove logging to /dev/xconsole in 50-default.conf on Ubuntu systems.  This is generally not something you'd want to do and produces error messages at startup.

## v.1.15.0 (2015-02-23)
- Change minimum supported Fedora release to 20 to align with the Fedora product lifecycle
- Add supports CentOS to metadata
- Update Rubocop and Test Kitchen dependencies to the latest versions
- Update Chefspec to 4.0
- Fix CentOS 5 support in the Kitchen config
- Fix rsyslog service notification in the file_input LWRP

## v.1.14.0 (2015-01-30)
- Don't attempt to use journald on Amazon Linux since Amazon Linux doesn't use systemd
- Fixed setting bad permissions on the working directory by using the rsyslog user/group variables.
- Fixed bad variable in the 49-relp.conf template that prevented Chef converges from completing.
- Removed the 'reload' action from the rsyslog service as newer rsyslog releases don't support reload.
- Updated Chefspecs to remove deprecation warnings and added additional tests.
- Removed node name from the comment block in the config files.
- Added a new file_input LWRP for defining configs.
- Added support for chef solo search cookbook.

## v1.13.0 (2014-11-25)
- Rsyslog's working directory is now an attribute and is set to the appropriate directory on RHEL based distros
- The working directory is now 0700 vs 0755 for additional security
- Add the ActionQueueMaxDiskSpace directive with a default of 1GB to prevent out of disk events during large buffering
- Updated RHEL / Fedora facilities to match those shipped by the distros
- Updated modules to match those used by journald (systemd) on Fedora 19+ and CentOS 7
- Added an attribute additional_directives to pass a hash of configs.  This is currently only being used to pass directives necessary for journald support on RHEL 7 / Fedora 19+

- Removed references to rsyslog v3 in the config template
- Added a chefignore file
- Updated Gemfile with newer releases of Test Kitchen, Rubocop, and Berkshelf
- Added Fedora 20, Debian 6/7, CentOS 7, and Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 to the Test Kitchen config
- Removed an attribute that was in the Readme twice
- Updated Travis to Ruby 2.1.1 to better match Chef 12
- Updated the Berksfile to point to Supermarket
- Refactored the specs to be more dry
