# DataCite-ORCID metadata search and claim

An online tool for searching for works in the DataCite metadata
catalogue and adding them to an ORCID profile.

This is a project by [ORCID EU labs](https://github.com/ORCID-EU-Labs/) and [ODIN - ORCID and DataCite Interoperability Network](http://odin-project.eu)

Try out our live running instance at [http://datacite.labs.orcid-eu.org](http://datacite.labs.orcid-eu.org)


## Background

The application is a fork of the Sinatra-based [CrossRef Metadata Search](http://search.crossref.org) tool by [CrossRef](http://crossref.org).


## Installation

### Requirements

- Ruby (2.1 or higher)
- git
- Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com
- Chef: http://www.opscode.com/chef/
- Virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org


### Installation

    git clone https://github.com/datacite/DataCite-ORCID.git
    cd DataCite-ORCID
    gem install librarian-chef
    librarian-chef install
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
    cp .env.example .env
    vagrant up

If you don't see any errors from the last command, you now have a properly
configured Ubuntu virtual machine running `DataCite-ORCID`. You can point your
browser to `http://10.2.2.12`.
