        in Spain and the third largest in Europe. Belonging to the Spanish Ministry
        of Economy and Competitiveness through the Secretary of State for Research,
        Development and Innovation, its main objective is to develop and promote research
        that will help bring about scientific and technological progress, and it is
        prepared to collaborate with Spanish and foreign entities in order to achieve
        this aim. Its mission is to foster, coordinate, develop and promote scientific
        and technological research, of a multidisciplinary nature, in order to contribute
        to advancing knowledge and economic, social and cultural development, as well
        as to train staff and advise public and private entities on this matter. CSIC
        plays an important role in scientific and technological policy, since it encompasses
        an area that takes in everything from basic research to the transfer of knowledge
        to the productive sector. Its research is driven by its institutes, which
        are spread across all the autonomous regions, and its more than 15,000 staff,
        of whom more than 3,000 are staff researchers and the same number again are
        doctors and scientists who are still training. CSIC has 6% of all the staff
        dedicated to Research and Development in Spain, and  generates approximately
        20% of all scientific production in the country. It also manages a range of
        important facilities; the most complete and extensive network of specialized
        libraries, and also has joint research units with other research performing

        comprising publications, grey literature, datasets, software code, conference
        objects, working papers and reports, policy documents, theses, blog postings,
        preprint articles and many more. Further, such variety of research outputs
        spans across 8 broad scientific areas ranging from hard sciences to social
        sciences and humanities. CSIC involvement in the DataCite consortium ensures
        that it will be active in global initiatives addressing the issues surrounding
        research data, including those of publication, citation and standards. CSIC  will
        run its Cite My Data service since 2016. This service allows CSIC’s researcher  to
