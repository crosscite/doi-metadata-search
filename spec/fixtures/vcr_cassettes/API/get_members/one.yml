        National Data Server","description":"\u003cp\u003eThe task of the Australian
        National Data Service (ANDS) is to build the Australian Research Data Commons
        by creating the infrastructure to enable Australian researchers to easily
        publish, discover, access and reuse research data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur
        approach is to engage in partnerships with research institutions to encourage
        better local data management, which enables structured collections to be created
        and information about these collections to be published via \u003ca href=\"http://researchdata.ands.org.au/\"\u003eResearch
        Data Australia\u003c/a\u003e, a discovery service provided by ANDS to help
        researchers to find and access Australian research data. It contains descriptions
        of research data that is held by contributing organisations and institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eANDS
        involvement in the DataCite consortium ensures that we are active in global
        initiatives addressing the issues surrounding research data, including those
        of publication, citation and standards. ANDS has run its \u003ca href=\"http://ands.org.au/services/cite-my-data.html\"\u003eCite
        My Data\u003c/a\u003e service since 2011. This service allows Australian research
        organisations to assign DOIs to their own research collections. This, in turn,
        provides researchers with a means of citing their published data and achieving
        recognition for their research data output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSubscribe
