        in the DataCite consortium ensures that we are active in global initiatives
        addressing the issues surrounding research data, including those of publication,
        citation and standards. ANDS has run its \u003ca href=\"http://ands.org.au/services/cite-my-data.html\"\u003eCite
        My Data\u003c/a\u003e service since 2011. This service allows Australian research
        organisations to assign DOIs to their own research collections. This, in turn,
        provides researchers with a means of citing their published data and achieving
        recognition for their research data output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSubscribe
