        do this through working in trusted partnerships on research data projects,

        in the DataCite consortium ensures that we are active in global initiatives
        addressing the issues surrounding research data, including those of publication,
        citation and standards. ANDS has run its \u003ca href=\"http://ands.org.au/services/cite-my-data.html\"\u003eCite
        My Data\u003c/a\u003e service since 2011. This service allows Australian research
        organisations to assign DOIs to their own research collections. This, in turn,
        provides researchers with a means of citing their published data and achieving
        recognition for their research data output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSubscribe
