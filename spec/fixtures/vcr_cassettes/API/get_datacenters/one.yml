        Organization for Nuclear Research, is the world\u0026#39;s largest particle
        physics laboratory. Founded in 1954 and based on the Franco-Swiss border near
        Geneva, it was one of Europe\u0026#39;s first joint ventures and now has 21
        member states and more than 50 cooperation agreements and scientific contacts
        with other countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt CERN, physicists and
        engineers probe the fundamental structure of the universe. They use the world\u0026#39;s
        largest and most complex scientific instrument, the Large Hadron Collider
        (LHC), to study the basic constituents of matter. The results of their experimental
        and theoretical work are publicly available following CERN\u0026#39;s Open
        Access Policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCERN services implementing DOIs
        are its institutional repository (CDS, CERN Document Server); INSPIRE-HEP,
        a digital library for the field of High-Energy Physics run in collaboration
        with other institutions; or the CERN Open Data Portal, which provides high
        level and analyzable data and software from the LHC experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore,
        CERN is also providing DOIs to ZENODO, a multidisciplinary data repository
        for the “long tail” of research results. It allows researchers to share and
